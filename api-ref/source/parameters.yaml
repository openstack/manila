volume_type:
  description: |
    The volume type. The use of the ``volume_type``
    object is deprecated but supported. It is recommended that you use
    the ``share_type`` object when you create a share type. When you
    issue a create a share type request, you can submit a request body
    with either a ``share_type`` or ``volume_type`` object. No matter
    which object type you include in the request, the API creates both
    a ``volume_type`` object and a ``share_type`` object. Both objects
    have the same ID. When you issue a list share types request, the
    response shows both ``share_types`` and ``volume_types`` objects.

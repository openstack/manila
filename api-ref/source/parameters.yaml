service_token_locks:
  description: |
    An auth-token specified via the header ``X-Service-Token``. With the
    OpenStack Identity (Keystone) context, this token can be obtained by
    a user that has the ``service`` role. The presence of this header is
    used by resource lock API methods to set or match the lock user's context.
    A resource lock created by a service user cannot be manipulated by
    non-service users.

    The project ID of the user or service making the API request. This

    service doesn't yet support API version 2.60, ensure that the service
    catalog endpoint obtained for the service has the user's project_id
    after the "/v2/" component, for example, the API to retrieve shares is
    *GET /v2/{project_id}/shares*. If the service doesn't yet support API
    version 2.60, and the project_id is ommitted from the API URL, a
    Malformed Request error is returned (HTTP 400).

project_id_quota_request_path:
  description: |
    The ID of the project whose quotas must be acted upon by the API. This
    is optional, and if it is not specified, the project ID is derived from
    the caller's API token. System/Domain scoped users interacting with this
    API *must* specify the project ID for the project whose quotas they need
    to query or manipulate.

    Note that this ID can be different from the project ID that precedes the
    resource name "quota-sets". For example, in a multi-tenant cloud, the
    first ID in the URL is typically the project ID of a privileged user
    (such as a cloud administrator) that can create, query or delete quotas
    of other projects in the cloud. If a server supports API version 2.60,
    URLs no longer need the privileged user's project ID prior to the resource
    name.

     However, during the switchover phase the share will be re-exported
     at the destination, causing the share to be rendered inaccessible for
     the duration of this phase. As of Ocata release, host-assisted
     migration cannot provide this capability.

writable_server_migration:
  description: |
     Specifies whether migration should only be performed
     if the shares can remain writable. When this behavior is set to ``True``
     and drivers are not capable of allowing the shares to remain writable,
     migration will result in an error status. If drivers are not capable
     of performing a nondisruptive migration, manila will ensure that the
     shares will remain writable through the data copy phase of migration.
     However, during the switchover phase all shares will be re-exported
     at the destination, causing the shares to be rendered inaccessible for
     the duration of this phase.

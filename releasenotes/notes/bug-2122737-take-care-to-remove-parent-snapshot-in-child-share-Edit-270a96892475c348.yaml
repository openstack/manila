    NetApp Driver bug #2122737
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2122737>_: During the "Create
    share from snapshot" operation, the NetApp Manila driver first creates the
    clone and then splits it. During this process, the newly created Manila
    share from the snapshot initially contains the same snapshot as the parent
    share. As part of this fix, the snapshot copied to the new share is
    deleted.

    Netapp ONTAP driver now handles a case where a volume to be deleted has
    one or more clones. The clones are splitted by bringing the volume online
    and then made offline to delete it. For more details, please refer to
    `launchpad bug #2086762 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2086762>`_.

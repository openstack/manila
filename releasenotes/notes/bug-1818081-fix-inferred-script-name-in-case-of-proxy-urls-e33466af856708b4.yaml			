    When manila API is run behind a proxy webserver, the API service was
    parsing the major API version requested incorrectly, leading to incorrect
    responses. This behavior has now been fixed. See `launchpad bug 1818081
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1818081>`_ for more details.

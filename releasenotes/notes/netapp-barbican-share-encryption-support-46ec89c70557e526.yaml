    The NetApp driver now supports configuring barbican keystore with the
    share server whenever an encryption-key-ref is passed in share create
    command and it enables encryption on the created share. The feature
    at this level offers only encrypted share creation and deletion.
    Note: Controlling encryption keys with NetApp will only be possible
    with DHSS=True. This feature is supported for ONTAP versions >= 9.17.1.

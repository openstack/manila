    NetApp Driver `bug #2128702
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2128702>`_:
    Previously, setting netapp_delete_retention_hours to 0 in the
    Manila configuration did not configure the retention period to zero.
    This patch fixes the issue, and the retention period can now be set
    to zero.

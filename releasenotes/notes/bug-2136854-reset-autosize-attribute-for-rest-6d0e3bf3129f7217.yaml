    NetApp Driver: bug #2136854
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2136854>_:
    Implemented reset functionality in Netapp driver's REST API client for
    volume autosize attributes.
    In ZAPI, the volume-autosize-attributes includes a reset property that
    resets the volume's minimum and maximum size and sets the autosize mode
    to either off or grow_shrink, depending on the volume type (DP or RW).
    However, this functionality is missing in the REST API, so we use the
    private CLI endpoint to handle autosize reset operations in REST.

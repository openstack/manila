    Support boot from volume for DHSS mode service instance.
    Boot volume can be created either from an image or an assigned base volume,
    depending on configuration.

    For create boot from volume with image as source.
    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [$DRIVER_NAME|DEFAULT]
        service_image_name = 'manila-service-image'
        service_instance_boot_from_volume = True

    This will automatically create volume that base on the service image.

    And for create boot from volume with base volume as source.
    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [$DRIVER_NAME|DEFAULT]
        base_boot_volume_id = '42c3cdca-1e84-4654-9068-59b192ff8f32'
        service_instance_boot_from_volume = True

    This will create new volume base on that base boot volume.

    Once volume is ready, it will attached to server as bootable volume.

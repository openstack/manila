  - A human readable ``mount_point_name`` can be specified as a option
    while managing shares through the mount_point_name parameter,

    Manila will prepend a prefix to the mount point name which
    can be configured through the ``provisioning:mount_point_prefix``
    in share type extra spec, or ``default_mount_point_prefix``
    configuration.

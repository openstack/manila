    A new configuration  option named
    ``data_manager_backup_supported_share_protocols`` is now available to
    allow operators define which protocols are supported when using the
    data manager for share backups. In case the backup creation is
    requested for a share whose protocol is not supported by the data
    manager service, the operation will fail. For more details, please
    refer to
    `Launchpad bug 2088063 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2088063>`_.
